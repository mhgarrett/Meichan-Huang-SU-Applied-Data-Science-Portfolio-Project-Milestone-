# Wine-review-data-visualization-and-analysis
This is an exploritory project working with three data sources to complete the tasks related to wine reviews.
In this report, I will discuss the data acquiring and data wrangling process. I will discuss the nature of the data. Lastly, I will answer eleven research questions based on the dataset and provide insights into the questions. The goal of this project was to understand wine reviews by geolocations, varieties, points, price, and also text analysis of what descriptors are frequently associated with reviews of certain wines.  

Data source 1: 
For the final project, I originally decided to analyze the wine reviews from Wine Enthusiast https://www.winemag.com/ratings/. However, since the web scrapping was not successful even with codes I found, I resorted to the dataset that was scrapped in 2017 (available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews). There were 14 columns in the data and approximately 130K entries of data. The columns included:

Data source 2: 
Since the data from the original scrapping was from 2017, which is a little dated, I searched Kaggle and found an updated dataset from 2020 (available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manyregression/updated-wine-enthusiast-review)  The author excluded duplicated values from the original 2017 dataset and added two attributes: “taster photo” and “vintage”. However, since I am not interested in these attributes. I dropped them when I loaded the data into the Jupyter notebook. This data provided additional 80k reviews of wine from different countries.

Data source 3: 
The third data source was the longitudinal and latitudinal dataset for all the countries under the name of “world_country_and_usa_states_latitude_and_longitude_values.csv”. The data is available at Kaggle from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/latitude-and-longitude-for-every-country-and-state. I did some cleaning and only included the world country latitude and longitude for my analysis. This dataset included four attributes: country code (abbreviation), longitude, latitude, and country (name).

Business questions: 

Question 1: Which countries and provinces had the MOST and LEAST reviews (demographic distributions of wine reviews)?

Question 2: What is the MEAN, MIN and MAX points received for wines from the most and least reviewed countries and provinces? 

Question 3: What was the MEAN, MIN and MAX price of wine by country?

Question 4: How many wines were reviewed by category? What are the top 10 wine varieties reviewed?

Question 5: What are the MEAN, MIN and MAX scores, particular for top 10 most reviewed varieties?

Question 6: What was the MEAN, MIN and MAX prices of wine by top 10 reviewed varieties?

Question 7: For each country, what type of wine is most reviewed?

Question 8: What is the correlation between the price and score of a bottle of wine?

Question 9: What types of descriptors were frequently associated categories of wine in the reviews? e.g. what kind of fruit flavor were typically used in the wine reviews?
