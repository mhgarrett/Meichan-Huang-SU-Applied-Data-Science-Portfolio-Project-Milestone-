# Project 4:  FudgeWorld (Fudgemart and Fedgeflix) Dataware Management
## Project Description 
In the IST722 Data Warehouse course instructed by Dr. Humayun Khan during Summer 2023, I acquired a holistic understanding of business intelligence (BI) and the pivotal role of data warehouse solutions in advancing organizational decision-making processes. This comprehensive course enabled me to acquire the technical aspects of data warehouses, offering me the knowledge to navigate through complex database constructs such as Operational Data Stores (ODS), Data Warehouses, and Data Marts. Furthermore, the course sharpened my skills in describing and applying various data integration approaches, including Extract, Transform, Load (ETL), Enterprise Information Integration (EII), and Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). 
The final project for IST 722: Data Warehouse served as a comprehensive demonstration of such knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course. The knowledge and skills involved are essential for managing the seamless flow of data across various systems, ensuring both its quality and consistency. The project involved working with two simulated data warehouses, FudgeMart and FudgeFlex, which are analogous to Amazon and Netflix, respectively. These entities were presented as a merged company, setting the stage for our objective: to construct a BI solution from the ground up. Since both Fudgemart and Fudgeflix had relational databases before the merge and both companies made a large investment in data and data analysis.  With the new merger management decided that a merged data warehouse was needed to allow data analysis from both companies as well as historical data from prior to the merger. Management wants the ability to do analysis of Fudgeworld sales while also being able to drill down into the specifics of which business line is contributing to the sales (i.e. fudgemart or fudgeflix).
Collaborating with Jake Conard, we constructed the FudgeWorld data warehouse using the ETL process, aiming to gaining insights into the sales of the merged company. This process required using different BI solutions, e.g. extracting the original data from SQL server, deploying SSIS  to construct MOLAP cube and loading the data into a data warehouse to connect PowerBI to gain business insights of the company sales. 
We started with the creation of a project charter to setting up our business objectives and shaping a comprehensive project schedule for our project. Then based on our business goals, we designed high-level dimensional modeling to outline the data structure of the data warehouse, i.e. what tables do we need to extract from the database for our analytic purposes.  
To uphold data integrity and security, a crucial step involved extracting the data from its original database and creating a staged copy within the data warehouse. This step allows a controlled environment where data could be transformed and loaded without compromising its original state. To achieve this goal,  we created the detailed-level dimensional modeling, which included the data's attributes and relationships, paving the way for the generation of an SQL script. This script was designed to facilitate the extraction of data into a data warehouse staged from the SQL server, where the original company data were stored. 
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) was utilized to establish a connection with the SQL servers, enabling the extraction and loading of essential data tables into the Fudgeworld data warehouse, thereby facilitating comprehensive BI analysis aligned with our business objectives.

Then we incorporated the external sources (zipcodes and date variables) to create MOLAP cubes using SISS, enabling us to perform data analysis with enhanced efficiency and flexibility (Figure 1). The cubes facilitated the transformation processes, allowing for dynamic analysis and insights generation from the structured data.

Lastly, the data in the staged FudgeWorld data warehouse was loaded into PowerBI to create dashboards to gain insights into the business sales based on regions, months, and merchandise categories, as followed (Figure X):

## Reflection and Learning Goals 
I believe that the final project for IST 722: Data Warehouse has encapsulated the essence of the program's goals: from data collection and management to insight generation and communication, with a strong emphasis on ethical considerations and practical applications. Reflecting on the process of completing the project, the technical application phase underscored the importance of programming proficiency and ethical data management practices. Specifically, utilizing SQL Server not only demonstrated my capability to structure and manage data with integrity but also instilled a deep appreciation for the ethical considerations that underpin data handling. The implementation of ETL processes using SSIS packages was a significant learning curve that honed my skills in data preparation and quality assurance. This experience illuminated the critical role of accuracy and usability in data science, reinforcing the necessity of meticulous data management. Furthermore, constructing an SSAS cube for analytics and developing BI dashboards and applications in Power BI was transformative to me. It not only solidified my technical skills but also enhanced my ability to communicate complex insights in an accessible manner to a diverse audience. This project through data warehouse construction, ETL processes, and BI development has been enlightening, challenging me to blend technical skills with ethical practices and effective communication to make data more meaningful and impactful.
