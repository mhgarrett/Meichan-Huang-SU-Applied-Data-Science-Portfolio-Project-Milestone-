# Meichan-Huang-SU-Applied-Data-Science-Portfolio-Project-Milestone-

The Masterâ€™s of Science of Applied Data Science at Syracuse University is designed to focus on the practical application of data science across various facets of enterprise operations, encompassing data acquisition and management, in-depth analysis, and the strategic communication necessary for informed decision-making.
My experience gained throughout this program equipped me with a solid foundation in both the theoretical underpinnings of data science and its real-world applications. I learnt to navigate the complexities of data mining, manage datasets, design and maintain databases, and data analysis to unveil valuable insights, and communicate these findings effectively to drive decision-making processes. 
This portfolio showcases my ability to integrate the diverse knowledge and skills acquired, applying them to develop innovative solutions to operational challenges across different industries (airlines, medical, wine etc.). <br>

Demonstrating mastery in data science requires more than understanding its principles; it demands the creative application of these principles to solve novel problems. In this portfolio, I demonstrate my ability to apply these principles in the following projects:  <br>

Project 1: IST 652: Scripting for Data Analysis & IST 644: Natural Language Processing	Wine review data analysis and  text classification <br>
Project 2: IST 736: Text Mining	Airline Tweets Sentiment Analysis <br>
Project 3: IST 718: Big Data Analytics	Pneumonia X-Ray Image classification <br>
Project 4: IST 722:Data Warehouse	FudgeWorld  Data Warehouse Management <br>
Project 5: IST 707: Applied Machine Learning 	Credit Card Fraud Detection <br>
